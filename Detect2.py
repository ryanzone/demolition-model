"""Stage 2 - YOLOv8 identifies material/objects.
   Stage 3 - YOLOv8-seg segments visible cracks / damaged regions.
   Stage 2.5/5 - Claude LLM: vision fallback/cross-check + natural-language explanation.

Two custom weight files are expected in backend/weights/:
  materials.pt    YOLOv8 detect model trained on your material classes
  cracks-seg.pt   YOLOv8-seg model trained on a crack / damage dataset
If they are missing the service runs in DEMO MODE (material = "unknown" and an
OpenCV crack heuristic replaces YOLOv8-seg) so the whole app still works.

Claude integration (new): set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to enable it. It never replaces
the trained CV/ML models -- it does two honest, separate jobs:
  1. claude_assess()      a vision cross-check / fallback material+damage read,
                           used when YOLO weights aren't present yet.
  2. generate_explanation() turns the ALREADY-DECIDED structured recommendation
                           (from pipeline.recommend) into a human-readable
                           paragraph. It explains the decision, it doesn't make it.
Both degrade to None/a template string with no API key configured, matching the
existing demo_mode pattern below -- the app never breaks if the key is missing.
